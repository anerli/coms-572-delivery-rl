Notice:
These arrays can be accessed by [x, y] but they are stored
as though each subarray is a column.

So 
[
	[a, b, c],
	[1, 2, 3]
]

Represents the game state:
a 1
b 2
c 3

-> This is why we have the render function to make it prettier anyway.

This confusion is necessary due to conflicting coventions of matrix
indexing and digital 2D space representation. (i.e. (row, col)~(y, x) vs (x, y))
