'''
Notice:
These arrays can be accessed by [x, y] but they are stored
as though each subarray is a column.

So 
[
	[a, b, c],
	[1, 2, 3]
]

Represents the game state:
a 1
b 2
c 3

-> This is why we have the render function to make it prettier anyway.

This confusion is necessary due to conflicting coventions of matrix
indexing and digital 2D space representation. (i.e. (row, col)~(y, x) vs (x, y))

Not true:
        # Since we use [x, y] to setup state, 
        # in order to draw it as if x is horizontal and y is vertical, 
        # x needs to be the column and y needs to be the row.
        # However when we set [x, y] we were setting [row, col]
        # Thus we need to switch x and y when rendering.

Since accessing mat by [x,y] it doesn't matter how it's internally stored really
